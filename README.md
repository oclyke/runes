# runes

Goal: create a unicode alphabet that seamlessly translates between English and runes.

Concept:
- English uses the roman alphabet which is not good at making the sounds of the English language.
- Runes match the english phonetics.
- I wish to bridge the two.

I think there will be a medium-sized combination of roman glyph patterns which occur frequently to make english noises. Those patterns should be replaced with single glyphs which look like themselves right side up and like runes upside down.

Two major parts:
1. The mapping - this part is independent of the font.
2. The font - generated as a kind of optical illusion with generative ai tools.

3. The unspoken part - what do you do when you turn the paper upside down? Do you need to read in the opposite direction? Is there something clever to be done that allows you to read in the same direction?

Maybe the first thing we could try doing is just to use the optical illusion technique to make simple sentences which work in both orientations.
